- **AI-Powered Conversations**: Engage in conversations with YeezyBot AI, and experience interactions that mirror the real Kanye West's style and insights.

- **AI Training**: Learn the art of AI model training using MindsDB Cloud, which enables you to fine-tune your bot to sound even more like Kanye himself.

- **Frontend Interface**: YeezyBot AI features a user-friendly frontend built with Next.js, making it easy to interact with the AI and enjoy its responses.

- **Local Deployment**: You'll learn how to set up a local API server to run your YeezyBot AI and see it in action on your own machine.

  Certainly! Here's a summary of the technologies used in the YeezyBot AI application and instructions for setting up the server locally:

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for backend development and AI model training.

- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the backend server and API.

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for building the frontend of the application, providing server-side rendering and routing.

- **MindsDB**: A machine learning platform used for training and fine-tuning the AI model to emulate Kanye West's style and personality.

- **OpenAI API**: Leveraged to integrate text generation capabilities into the AI model, enabling natural language conversations.

## Setting Up the Server Locally

Follow these steps to set up the server locally:

### Frontend (Client) Setup

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Your frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Backend (Server) Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install the required Python dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the backend server by executing:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

4. Your frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

Now, you've successfully set up both the frontend and backend of the YeezyBot AI application locally. You can interact with the bot and see it in action on your own machine. Enjoy your conversations with Kanye-inspired AI!
